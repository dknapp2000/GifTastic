Here I am building a list item in memory,
An anchor child is created, and attributes (href, searchTerm and innerHTML)
are added to it, and then it is appended as a child to the li tag.
Finally the build up list item is appended to the dom.

Question; is there a more efficient pure JS way to do this?
Is there some idom that is common?

Thanks,  ddk

function addTopicLi( pTopic ) {
    var li = document.createElement("li");
    var a = document.createElement("a");
    a.href="#";
    a.dataset.searchTerm = pTopic;
    a.innerHTML = pTopic;
    li.appendChild( a );
    ptrSideBarNav.appendChild( li );
}
